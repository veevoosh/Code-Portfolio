							<p>Okay, but for real. No more in-character haha funny bits.</p>
							<p>
								This is a personal passion project dedicated to an independent animated series on YouTube by Liam Vickers called "Murder Drones", where, from the title itself, is about drones that try to [and succeed] at murdering each other (for personal and lore-heavy reasons). After I finished watching the whole show about four months ago, it gave me a boost of creative inspiration and motivation to keep pursuing art and keep on being a dorky weirdo. <i>(...That would explain all the brainrot-speak here PFFFT)</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								But, yes. With my current hyperfixation with Gravity Falls and Murder Drones, they're the ones who are fuelling my drive to keep on drawing and improve on 'being myself'. Corny, but it's true. These cartoons genuinely helped me in seeing how people can just... be themselves, and be weird. Free to be a deformed jellybean among the other normal beans. And these shows made me believe that that's... okay.
							</p>
							<p>
								I hope that while I'm building this webpage, although it has been an admittedly slow process, I can finally get the courage to stop being scared of the cringe, and instead... <i>embrace the cringe</i>. And maybe whoever sees this can see that being weird is okay. <i>As long as its like, y'know, not inherently threatening, damaging, or world-ending to any form of life whatsoever, of course.</i>
							</p>
							<p>Anyway — this time, I'm saying this not as Uzi Doorman, but as Vashti Domingo.</p>
							<p>I hope you enjoy your stay here, even if you're not a fan of Murder Drones.</p>
							<p>And always remember these wise words of a certain author from another dimension:</p>
							<p><b>Stay curious, stay kind, and <i><u>STAY WEIRD</u>!!!</i></b>
